Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside.
To entertain himself, he sang out,
“Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”


When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away.
But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.
